# üß© Next.js Task App ‚Äì Frontend

A frontend application built with **Next.js App Router** for managing collaborative ToDo applications.

---
## Getting Started

First, clone the repository [https://github.com/rafi-ruetcse17/frontend.git](https://github.com/rafi-ruetcse17/frontend.git)

Open terminal (i.e. VS Code) and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## üîê 1. Authentication

- Users can **Sign Up** using name, email, and password.
- Users can **Log In** using email and password.
- These are **public API routes**.
- Session is managed using **NextAuth (JWT strategy)**.
- **Axios interceptor** is used to attach token automatically to every REST API request.

### Critical Thinking Outcome:
1. **Authorization header** is automatically sent for all protected routes so that auth guard can easily be implemented on server.

**See Authentication Demo**: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zhefyYWiigrj6W3etrtZtN4lxkzdVDO/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zhefyYWiigrj6W3etrtZtN4lxkzdVDO/view?usp=sharing)

## üß≠ 2. Navigation

- All authenticated pages include a **navbar** from `layout.js` under `/user/*`.
- Navbar provides:
  - A **Logout** button.
  - A button to return to the **App List Page**.

### Critical Thinking Outcome:
1. Button to return **App List Page** is skipped on app list page as it is unnecessary.

## üìã 3. ToDo App List Page  
**Route**: `/user`

- Landing page after login.
- Displays **all apps** the user has access to.
- Each app card shows:
  - **Title**
  - **Created time**
  - **User role** (owner/collaborator)
- Clicking on an app redirects to its **task list**.

### Critical Thinking Outcome:
1. Apps are **sorted by latest creation time** for quick access to newly created ones to enhance **user experience**.
2. Deletion is protected with a modal to avoid **accidental removal**.

**See Demo**: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWmEQyGzy47ByBKo_LoZMY47XSwE0iEN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWmEQyGzy47ByBKo_LoZMY47XSwE0iEN/view?usp=sharing)

## üìã 4. Create Todo App

**Route:** `/user/apps/create`

- User can input the **App Title** to create a new ToDo App.
- Upon successful creation, user is **redirected** to the App List page.

**Implementation Notes:**

- `react-hook-form` is used to manage form state and validation efficiently.
- Form includes error handling and loading states for better UX.

**See app creation demo**: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BudjZZ6lvgnGsyYoIBk2DSP249QkfYcN/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BudjZZ6lvgnGsyYoIBk2DSP249QkfYcN/view?usp=drive_link)

## üìã 5. Tasks List of an App

**Route:** `/user/[appId]/tasks/[pageNumber]`

- Each task includes a **status**: `in progress`, `completed`, or `stale`.
- **Users with Editor or Owner** roles can:
  - Add/Edit/Delete task
  - Change task status
- **Users with View-only** access can only see the task list.
- **App Owners** can invite other users and assign them a role (`viewer`, `editor`).

### Critical Thinking Outcome:

- **Pagination** is implemented to improve API performance and reduce page load time.
- Tasks are **sorted by latest creation time** for better visibility of recent activity.
- **Confirmation modal** appears before task deletion to prevent accidental removals.
- Tasks status are managed through **seperate enum** file for code reusability.

**See task list demo**: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QbimrakflqwfaEFzrIUCjtunDCRv1PGv/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QbimrakflqwfaEFzrIUCjtunDCRv1PGv/view?usp=sharing)
